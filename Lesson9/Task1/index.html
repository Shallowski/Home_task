            <div class="article__section section1">This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling.
                About
                twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive,
                slackenong its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too
                great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
                bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
                moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.

                The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most
                reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please
                the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers
                upon them.

                "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they
                were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
                programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
